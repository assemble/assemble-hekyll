## Usage

```js
var hekyll = require('{%= name %}');
var assemble = require('assemble');
var app = module.exports = assemble();
app.use(hekyll());
```

## Usage

```js
var hekyll = require('{%= name %}');
```

## Quickstart

The easiest way to convert and build a Jekyll theme with assemble is to start by using [generate-hekyll][] to convert the theme. generate-hekyll has built-in support for all of GitHub's default Jekyll themes, as well as all of the awesome [poole](https://github.com/poole) themes from [@mdo](https://github.com/mdo). 

See the [alternative steps](#alternative-steps) if you want more fine grained control over cloning and converting the theme.

### 1. Install generate-hekyll

First, install [generate][] and [generate-hekyll][]:

```sh
$ npm install -g generate generate-hekyll
```

### 2. Convert the theme you want

Next, run generate-hekyll to download and convert the theme you want:

```sh
$ gen hekyll
```

### 3. Customize and build!

Feel free to customize your [assemblefile.js](#assemblefilejs)! You should now be able to build the site at any time with the following command:

```sh
$ assemble
```

### Alternative steps

As an alternative to using `generate-hekyll` to convert the theme (steps 1 and 2), you can do the following.

**Step 1: git clone**

`git clone` the theme you want into a local directory.

**Step 2: Tell assemble where to find the theme**

In `assemblefile.js`, tell assemble where to find the Jekyll theme and where to write the converted handlebars files.

```js
app.option({
  // current working directory
  cwd: __dirname, 

  // path to the jekyll theme
  theme: 'vendor/poole/lanyon', 

  // path to write the converted files. remember, the generated files 
  // will become your "source" templates when you build the handlebars
  // theme with assemble
  destBase: 'src' 
});
```

**Step 3: Convert the theme**

Run the following to convert your theme.

```sh
$ assemble hekyll
```

## assemblefile.js

Example code to use in your `assemblefile.js`.

```js
var hekyll = require('{%= name %}');
var argv = require('minimist')(process.argv.slice(2));
var Assemble = require('assemble');

/**
 * Instantiate and expose your instance of assemble to assemble's CLI
 */

var app = module.exports = new Assemble(argv);

/**
 * Options
 */

// these options are necessary only if you're cloning the theme yourself
// using the alternative steps described above. Replace these values with
// your own.
app.option({cwd: __dirname, theme: 'vendor/poole/lanyon', destBase: 'src'});

// the following options are necessary if you want to download metadata
// from the repository to use in templates. Replace these values with
// the owner/repository to use for getting metadata.
app.option({owner: 'jonschlinkert', repo: 'hekyll'});

// if you want to download metadata, pass username and password, or token.
// note that the `metadata` task is skipped if these values aren't defined
app.option(require('./tmp/auth.json'));

/**
 * Register hekyll plugin
 */

app.use(hekyll(app.options));

/**
 * Default task
 */

app.task('default', ['theme']);
```

## Please help improve this project

As with any site, you'll need to make some customizations, and potentially fix any remaining issues that were missed by the plugin. If you find a bug, or something that doesn't work, but you think this plugin should handle it, please [don't hesitate to create an issue](../../issues/new).
